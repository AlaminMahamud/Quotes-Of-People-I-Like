# Immanuel Kant

All Our Knowledge begins with senses, proceed to understandings and ends with reason. There is nothing higher than reason

Thoughts without contents are empty. Intuition without concepts are blind

So act that your principle of action might safely be made a law for the whole world.

Science is organized knowledge. Wisdom is organized life.

Live your life as though your every act were to become a universal law.

Seek not the favor of the multitude; it is seldom got by honest and lawful means. But seek the testimony of few; and number not voices, but weigh them.

Morality is not properly the doctrine of how we may make ourselves happy, but how we may make ourselves worthy of happiness.

From such crooked wood as that which man is made of, nothing straight can be fashioned.
