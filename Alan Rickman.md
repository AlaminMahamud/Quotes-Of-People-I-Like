# Alan Rickman - Professor Severeus Snape

1. Talent is an accident of genes - and a responsibility
2. If people want to know who i m, it's all in work
3. I do take my work seriously and the way to do that is not to take yourself too seriously
4. Each Character I play has different dimensions. I'm not interested in words that pull them together.
5. Acting touches nerves you have absolutely no control over
6. I don't think that's right that everybody knows everything about me.
7. All I want to see from an actor is the intensity and accuracy of their listening.
